## API Automation framework

## :question: What is this Repository about?

An API Testing framework using Rest-assured.
I heard a lot about Rest-Assured and how it made the QA's life easier by helping them to run all the tedious API tests
in an efficient way.
Hence, we chose this framework. 

## :briefcase: What does this repo contain?
- This repo contains example codes of API Tests using Rest-Assured.
- `Hamcrest Matchers` are used for assertions.
- [TestNG][testng_website] Listeners are used to capture the events in logs.
- `Log4j` is used to capture logs.- [Lombok][Lombok_website] has been used to generate Getter and Setters automatically for post body requests.
